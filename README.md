# Mercedes-Co-Op
<b>Code written in mostly VBA during my co-op at Mercedes Benz U.S. International</b>

Most of the code in this repository is only linked in the fact that I wrote it all while on co-op at MBUSI. My job as a co-op 
included running daily and weekly reports for sets of data that were given to me. I was also expected to work on automating these
reports for the next co-ops and interns through macros, Access databases, and other available software. Occasionally, I was given 
tasks such as fixing code in Access databases and Tableau flows that other people needed done.

I came into this position with zero past experience of VBA or SQL, and worked with what resources were available to me online in the 
short amount of time that I was co-oping. This repository is a back-up of all code that was written during my time at MBUSI.

I have included a brief description of each file below.
